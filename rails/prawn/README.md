Prawn

I love this wonderful gem.  I am just starting to use it and have encountered a couple of issues I had to work out.  I'm not sure if they are specific to my local environment or if it's something general.

1. [Generating the Prawn manual](rails/prawn/prawn-manual.md)
1. [Installing Prawn for Rails 3+](rails/prawn/prawn-install.md)
